## FydeOS for You - Pinebook Pro

This repository holds artefacts for building FydeOS using [cros_sdk](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_guide.md#Building-Chromium-OS), usually provided as a Gentoo ebuild repository.

An ebuild repository, colloquially known as an "overlay", is a structure of directories and files used to add and extend software packages for a Gentoo-based system. Ebuild repositories contain ebuilds, eclasses, and other types of descriptive metadata files. These files inform the package manager of software available for installation. An ebuild repository should conform to one or more [Ebuild APIs](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EAPI).

For more details and step-by-step guide for using cros_sdk and building your own Chromium OS fork, please refer to the [Chromium OS Developer Guide](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_guide.md).
